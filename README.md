repository name: proof-of-presence-protocol Public

Description: This repository contains the Solidity code for the Proof of Presence Protocol, a decentralized application for proving the presence of a person at a specific location in time and space using data over audio and biometrics.

Files:
- ProofOfPresenceProtocol.sol: This file contains the main Solidity contract for the Proof of Presence Protocol. It includes functions for minting new hashed smartones, updating biometric identifiers, and other functionality related to the protocol.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the Proof of Presence Protocol and instructions for interacting with the contract.
- LICENSE: This file contains the licensing information for the code in this repository.

Dependencies:
- OpenZeppelin's SafeERC721 contract: This contract is used to implement the ERC721 functionality of the Proof of Presence Protocol.
- OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library: This library is used for safe arithmetic operations in the contract.

Usage:
To use the Proof of Presence Protocol, you will need to deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain and call the appropriate functions using a web3 interface, such as MetaMask. You can find detailed instructions for interacting with the contract in the README.md file![Proof of Physical Presence Logo 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62417773/210156296-96c9342e-43f0-4a95-befc-46c147b8d747.png)
